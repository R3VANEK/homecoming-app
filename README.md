## Description
This application's name is Homecoming, it was our project for the hackaton "BEST Hacks" 2022. The concept is simple. Imagine that your child is walking through the city late at night and you are worried about it. You can grab your phone and stay in contact the whole time, but this has some flaws:
- the walk might take long time and you can be unable to hold conversation whole time
- In case of emergency you dont always know when the accident happened

Our application Homecoming addresses these needs. If you walk somewhere unsafe, just open the app. It automatically starts to track your position, alert of dangerous places and in case of emergency your family and police will be notified

## Features
### Track your position
![slide1](https://github.com/R3VANEK/homecoming-app/blob/main/doc/4.png)
When you start your walk, simply open the app. It will show you a timer. When predefined time period will end, you are going to get a notification and vibration on your phone, indicating that you need to check if everything is all right

### Show dangerous places across the city

All users can submit dangerous places like particular dark alleys. Others can view them while taking a walk and avoid them

### Notify your significant ones
